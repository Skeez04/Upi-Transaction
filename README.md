## Getting Started

To begin with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```
   https://github.com/Skeez04/Upi-Transaction
   ```

2. Install the required software and libraries:

   - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) - For running the analysis notebooks.
   - Additional libraries specified in the analysis notebooks (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

3. Open a Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the repository's directory.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis can be found in the `data` directory. It includes:

- `UPI apps transaction data in 2021.csv` - Sample UPI transaction data containing details such as transaction amount, date, sender, and receiver.

## Analysis

The analysis notebooks in this repository cover various aspects of UPI transaction data:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Transaction Trends**: Analyzing transaction volume and amounts over time.
- **Sender-Receiver Relationships**: Exploring the frequency and amounts of transactions between different sender and receiver pairs.
- **Transaction Categories**: Categorizing transactions based on user-defined criteria.
- **Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations to understand the data.

## Usage

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the cloned repository's directory.

2. Open the desired analysis notebook (e.g., `upi-transaction.ipynb`).

3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the analysis steps and generate visualizations.

4. Customize the analysis by modifying parameters, queries, or visualizations as needed.

5. Utilize the insights gained from the analysis to inform business decisions related to UPI transactions.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for additional analyses, improvements to existing notebooks, or better visualizations, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
